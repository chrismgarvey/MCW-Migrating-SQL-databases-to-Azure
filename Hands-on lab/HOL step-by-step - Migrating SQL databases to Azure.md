# Migrating SQL databases to Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you implement a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database into Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI). You perform assessments to reveal any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database and the managed database offerings in Azure. You then migrate the customer's on-premises gamer information web application and database into Azure, with minimal to no down-time. Finally, you enable some of the advanced SQL features available in SQL MI to improve security and performance in the customer's application.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to implement a cloud migration solution for business-critical applications and databases.

## Overview

** TEST **

Tailspin Toys is the developer of several popular online video games. Founded in 2010, the company has experienced exponential growth since releasing the first installment of their most popular game franchise to include online multiplayer gameplay. They have since built upon this success by adding online capabilities to the majority of their game portfolio.

Adding online gameplay has dramatically increased the popularity of their games, but the rapid increase in demand for their services has made supporting the current setup problematic. To facilitate online gameplay, they host gaming services on-premises using rented hardware. For each game, their gaming services setup consists of three virtual machines running the gaming software and five game databases hosted on a single SQL Server 2008 R2 instance. In addition to the dedicated gaming VMs and databases, they also host shared authentication and gateway VMs and databases. At its foundation, Tailspin Toys is a game development company, made up primarily of software developers. The few dedicated database and infrastructure resources they do have are struggling to keep up with their ever-increasing workload.

Tailspin Toys is hoping that migrating their services from on-premises to the cloud can help to alleviate some of their infrastructure management issues, while simultaneously helping them to refocus their efforts on delivering business value by releasing new and improved games. They are looking for a proof-of-concept (PoC) for migrating their gamer information web application and database into the cloud. They maintain their gamer information database, `TailspinToys`, on an on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database. This system is used by gamers to update their profiles, view leader boards, purchase game add-ons, and more. Since this system helps to drive revenue, it is considered a business-critical application and needs to be highly-available. They are aware that SQL Server 2008 R2 is approaching the end of support, and are looking at options for migrating this database into Azure. They have read about some of the advanced security and performance tuning options that are available only in Azure and would prefer to migrate the database into a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering, if possible. Tailspin Toys is using the Service Broker feature of SQL Server for messaging within the `TailspinToys` database. This functionality enables several critical processes, and they cannot afford to lose these capabilities when migrating their operations database to the cloud. They have also stated that, at this time, they do not have the resources to rearchitect the solution to use an alternative message broker.

## Solution architecture

Below is a diagram of the solution architecture you implement in this lab. Please study this carefully, so you understand the whole of the solution as you are working on the various components.

![This solution diagram includes a virtual network containing SQL MI in an isolated subnet, along with a JumpBox VM and Database Migration Service in a management subnet. The MI Subnet displays both the primary managed instance, along with a read-only replica, which is accessed by reports from the web app. The web app connects to SQL MI via a subnet gateway and point-to-site VPN. The web app is published to App Services using Visual Studio 2019. Online data migration is conducted from the on-premises SQL Server to SQL MI using the Azure Database Migration Service, which reads backup files from an SMB network share.](./media/preferred-solution-architecture.png "Preferred Solution diagram")

The solution begins with using the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform assessments of feature parity and compatibility of the on-premises SQL Server 2008 R2 database. Assessments are performed against both Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB) and Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI). The goal is to migrate the `TailspinToys` database into an Azure PaaS offering with minimal or no changes. After completing the assessments and reviewing the findings, the SQL Server 2008 R2 database is migrated into SQL MI using the Azure Database Migration Service's online data migration option. Online data migration allows the database to be migrated with little to no downtime by using a backup and transaction logs stored in an SMB network share.

The web app is deployed to an Azure App Service Web App using Visual Studio 2019. Once the database has been migrated and cutover, the `TailspinToysWeb` application is configured to talk to the SQL MI VNet through a virtual network gateway using point-to-site VPN, and its connection strings are updated to point to the new SQL MI database.

In SQL MI, several features of Azure SQL Database are examined. Advanced Data Security (ADS) is enabled, and Data Discovery and Classification is used to better understand the data and potential compliance issues with data in the database. The ADS Vulnerability Assessment is used to identify potential security vulnerabilities and issues in the database, and those finding are used to mitigate one finding by enabling Transparent Data Encryption in the database. Dynamic Data Masking (DDM) is used to prevent sensitive data from appearing when querying the database. Finally, Read Scale-out is used to point reports on the Tailspin Toys web app to a read-only secondary, allowing reporting to occur without impacting the performance of the primary database.

## Requirements

- Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN.
  - Trial subscriptions will not work.
- A virtual machine configured with Visual Studio Community 2019 or higher (setup in the Before the hands-on lab exercises).
- **Important**: You must have sufficient rights within your Azure AD tenant to create an Azure Active Directory application and service principal and assign roles on your subscription to complete this hands-on lab.

## Exercise 1: Perform database assessments

Duration: 20 minutes

In this exercise, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to perform assessments on the `TailspinToys` database. You create two assessments, one for a migration to Azure SQL Database, and then a second for SQL MI. These assessments provide reports about any feature parity, and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure managed SQL database service options.

> DMA helps you upgrade to a modern data platform by detecting compatibility issues that can impact database functionality in your new version of SQL Server or Azure SQL Database. DMA recommends performance and reliability improvements for your target environment and allows you to move your schema, data, and uncontained objects from your source server to your target server. To learn more, read the [Data Migration Assistant documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/dma/dma-overview?view=azuresqldb-mi-current).

### Task 1: Configure the TailspinToys database on the SqlServer2008 VM

In this task, you do some configuration the `TailspinToys` database on the SQL Server 2008 R2 instance to prepare it for migration.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

    ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the list.

    ![Resource groups is selected in the Azure navigation pane, and the "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](./media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

3. In the list of resources for your resource group, select the SqlServer2008 VM.

    - **Password**: `Password.1234567890`

    ![The credentials specified above are entered into the Enter your credentials dialog.](media/rdc-credentials-sql-2008.png "Enter your credentials")

8. Select **Yes** to connect, if prompted that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified.

    ![In the Remote Desktop Connection dialog box, a warning states that the identity of the remote computer cannot be verified, and asks if you want to continue anyway. At the bottom, the Yes button is circled.](./media/remote-desktop-connection-identity-verification-sqlserver2008.png "Remote Desktop Connection dialog")

9. Once logged in, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** (SSMS) by entering "sql server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu and selecting **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** from the search results.

    ![SQL Server is entered into the Windows Start menu search box, and Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17 is highlighted in the search results.](media/start-menu-ssms-17.png "Windows start menu search")

10. In the SSMS **Connect to Server** dialog, enter **SQLSERVER2008** into the Server name box, ensure **Windows Authentication** is selected, and then select **Connect**.

    ![The SQL Server Connect to Search dialog is displayed, with SQLSERVER2008 entered into the Server name and Windows Authentication selected.](media/sql-server-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

11. Once connected, select **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The New Query button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-new-query.png "SSMS Toolbar")

12. Next, copy and paste the SQL script below into the new query window. This script enables Service broker and changes the database recovery model to FULL.

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    -- Update the recovery model of the database to FULL and enable Service Broker
    ALTER DATABASE TailspinToys SET
    RECOVERY FULL,
    ENABLE_BROKER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
    GO
    ```

13. To run the script, select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

### Task 2: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database

In this task, you use the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant (DMA) to assess the `TailspinToys` database against Azure SQL Database (Azure SQL DB). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the Azure SQL DB service.

1. On the SqlSever2008 VM, launch DMA from the Windows Start menu by typing "data migration" into the search bar, and then selecting **Microsoft Data Migration Assistant** in the search results.

    ![In the Windows Start menu, "data migration" is entered into the search bar, and Microsoft Data Migration Assistant is highlighted in the Windows start menu search results.](media/windows-start-menu-dma.png "Data Migration Assistant")

    ![Start assessment](media/dma-start-assessment-to-azure-sql-db.png "Start assessment")

10. Review the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL DB.

    ![For a target platform of Azure SQL DB, feature parity shows two features that are not supported in Azure SQL DB. The Service broker feature is selected on the left and on the right Service Broker feature is not supported in Azure SQL Database is highlighted.](media/dma-feature-parity-service-broker-not-supported.png "Database feature parity")

    > The DMA assessment for migrating the `TailspinToys` database to a target platform of Azure SQL DB shows two features in use that are not supported. These features, cross-database references and Service broker, prevent TailspinToys from being able to migrate to the Azure SQL DB PaaS offering without first making changes to their database.

### Task 3: Perform assessment for migration to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance

With one PaaS offering ruled out due to feature parity, perform a second DMA assessment against Azure SQL Database Managed Instance (SQL MI). The assessment provides a report about any feature parity and compatibility issues between the on-premises database and the SQL MI service.

1. To get started, select **+** on the left-hand menu in DMA to create another new project.

    ![The new project icon is highlighted in DMA.](media/dma-new.png "New DMA project")

2. In the New project pane, set the following:

    - **Project type**: Select **Assessment**.
    - **Project name**: Enter `ToSqlMi`
    - **Assessment type**: Select **Database Engine**.
    - **Source server type**: Select **SQL Server**.
    - **Target server type**: Select **Azure SQL Database Managed Instance**.

    ![The new project settings for doing a SQL Server to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance migration assessment are entered into the dialog.](media/dma-new-project-to-sql-mi.png "New project settings")

3. Select **Create**.

4. On the **Options** screen, ensure **Check database compatibility** and **Check feature parity** are both checked, and then select **Next**.

    ![Check database compatibility and check feature parity are checked on the Options screen.](media/dma-options.png "DMA options")

5. On the **Sources** screen, enter the following into the **Connect to a server** dialog that appears on the right-hand side:

    - **Server name**: Select **SQLSERVER2008**.
    - **Authentication type**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
    - **Username**: Enter `WorkshopUser`
    - **Password**: Enter `Password.1234567890`
    - **Encrypt connection**: Check this box.
    - **Trust server certificate**: Check this box.

    ![In the Connect to a server dialog, the values specified above are entered into the appropriate fields.](media/dma-connect-to-a-server.png "Connect to a server")

6. Select **Connect**.

7. On the **Add sources** dialog that appears next, check the box for **TailspinToys** and select **Add**.

    ![The TailspinToys box is checked on the Add sources dialog.](media/dma-add-sources.png "Add sources")

8. Select **Start Assessment**.

    ![Start assessment](media/dma-start-assessment-to-sql-mi.png "Start assessment")

9. Review the SQL Server feature parity and Compatibility issues options of the migration assessment to determine the possibility of migrating to Azure SQL Database Managed Instance.

    ![For a target platform of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, no issues are listed.](media/dma-feature-parity-sql-mi.png "Database feature parity")

    ![For a target platform of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, a message that full-text search has changed, and the list of impacted objects are listed.](media/dma-compatibility-issues-sql-mi.png "Compatibility issues")

    >**Note**: The assessment report for a migrating the `TailspinToys` database to a target platform of Azure SQL Database Managed Instance shows no feature parity and a note to validate full-text search functionality. The full text search changes do not impact the migration of the `TailspinToys` database to SQL MI.

10. The database, including the cross-database references and Service broker features, can be migrated as is, providing the opportunity for TailspinToys to have a fully managed PaaS database running in Azure. Previously, their options for migrating a database using features, such as Service Broker, incompatible with Azure SQL Database, were to deploy the database to a virtual machine running in Azure (IaaS) or modify their database and applications not to use the unsupported features. The introduction of Azure SQL MI, however, provides the ability to migrate databases into a managed Azure SQL database service with *near 100% compatibility*, including the features that prevented them from using Azure SQL Database.

## Exercise 2: Migrate the database to SQL MI

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you use the [Azure Database Migration Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/database-migration/) (DMS) to migrate the `TailspinToys` database from the on-premises SQL 2008 R2 database to SQL MI. Tailspin Toys mentioned the importance of their gamer information web application in driving revenue, so for this migration, the online migration option is used to reduce downtime. The [Business Critical service tier](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance#managed-instance-service-tiers) is targeted to meet the customer's high-availability requirements.

> The Business Critical service tier is designed for business applications with the highest performance and high-availability (HA) requirements. To learn more, read the [Managed Instance service tiers documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-managed-instance#managed-instance-service-tiers).

### Task 1: Create an SMB network share on the SqlServer2008 VM

In this task, you create a new SMB network share on the SqlServer2008 VM. This is the folder used by DMS for retrieving backups of the `TailspinToys` database during the database migration process.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, open **Windows Explorer** by selecting its icon on the Windows Taskbar.

    ![The Windows Explorer icon is highlighted in the Windows Taskbar.](media/windows-task-bar.png "Windows Taskbar")

2. In the Windows Explorer window, expand **Computer** in the tree view, select **Windows (C:)**, and then select **New folder** in the top menu.

    ![In Windows Explorer, Windows (C:) is selected under Computer in the left-hand tree view, and New folder is highlighted in the top menu.](media/windows-explorer-new-folder.png "Windows Explorer")

3. Name the new folder **dms-backups**, then right-click the folder and select **Share with** and **Specific people** in the context menu.

    ![In Windows Explorer, the context menu for the dms-backups folder is displayed, with Share with and Specific people highlighted.](media/windows-explorer-folder-share-with.png "Windows Explorer")

4. In the File Sharing dialog, ensure the **sqlmiuser** is listed with a **Read/Write** permission level, and then select **Share**.

    ![In the File Sharing dialog, the sqlmiuser is highlighted and assigned a permission level of Read/Write.](media/file-sharing.png "File Sharing")

5. In the **Network discovery and file sharing** dialog, select the default value of **No, make the network that I am connected to a private network**.

    ![In the Network discovery and file sharing dialog, No, make the network that I am connected to a private network is highlighted.](media/network-discovery-and-file-sharing.png "Network discovery and file sharing")

6. Back on the File Sharing dialog, note the path of the shared folder, `\\SQLSERVER2008\dms-backups`, and select **Done** to complete the sharing process.

    ![The Done button is highlighted on the File Sharing dialog.](media/file-sharing-done.png "File Sharing")

### Task 2: Change MSSQLSERVER service to run under sqlmiuser account

In this task, you use the SQL Server Configuration Manager to update the service account used by the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) to the `sqlmiuser` account. This is done to ensure the SQL Server service has the appropriate permissions to write backups to the shared folder.

1. On your SqlServer2008 VM, select the **Start menu**, enter "sql configuration" into the search bar, and then select **SQL Server Configuration Managed** from the search results.

    ![In the Windows Start menu, "sql configuration" is entered into the search box, and SQL Server Configuration Manager is highlighted in the search results.](media/windows-start-sql-configuration-manager.png "Windows search")

    > **Note**: Be sure to choose **SQL Server Configuration Manager**, and not **SQL Server 2017 Configuration Manager**, which does not work for the installed SQL Server 2008 R2 database.

2. In the SQL Server Configuration Managed dialog, select **SQL Server Services** from the tree view on the left, then right-click **SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER)** in the list of services and select **Properties** from the context menu.

    ![SQL Server Services is selected and highlighted in the tree view of the SQL Server Configuration Manager. In the Services pane, SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) is selected and highlighted. Properties is highlighted in the context menu.](media/sql-server-configuration-manager-services.png "SQL Server Configuration Manager")

3. In the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog, select **This account** under Log on as, and enter the following:

    - **Account name**: `sqlmiuser`
    - **Password**: `Password.1234567890`

    ![In the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties dialog, This account is selected under Log on as and the sqlmiuser account name and password are entered.](media/sql-server-service-properties.png "SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) Properties")

4. Select **OK**.

5. Select **Yes** in the Confirm Account Change dialog.

    ![The Yes button is highlighted in the Confirm Account Change dialog.](media/confirm-account-change.png "Confirm Account Change")

6. Observe that the **Log On As** value for the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service changed to `./sqlmiuser`.

    ![In the list of SQL Server Services, the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) service is highlighted.](media/sql-server-service.png "SQL Server Services")

7. Close the SQL Server Configuration Manager.

### Task 3: Create a backup of TailspinToys database

To perform online data migrations, DMS looks for backups and logs in the SMB shared backup folder on the source database server. In this task, you create a backup of the `TailspinToys` database using SSMS and write it to the `\\SQLSERVER2008\dms-backups` SMB network share you created in a previous task. The backup file needs to include a checksum, so you add that during the backup steps.

1. On the SqlServer2008 VM, open **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 17** by entering "sql server" into the search bar in the Windows Start menu.

    USE TailspinToys;
    GO

    INSERT [dbo].[Game] (Title, Description, Rating, IsOnlineMultiplayer)
    VALUES ('Space Adventure', 'Explore the universe with are newest online multiplayer gaming experience. Build custom  rocket ships, and take off for the stars in an infinite open-world adventure.', 'T', 1)
    ```

6. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** in the SSMS toolbar.

    ![The Execute button is highlighted in the SSMS toolbar.](media/ssms-execute.png "SSMS Toolbar")

7. After adding the new record to the `Games` table, back up the transaction logs. DMS detects any new backups and ships them to the migration service. Select **New Query** again in the toolbar, and paste the following script into the new query window:

    ```sql
    USE master;
    GO

    BACKUP LOG TailspinToys
    TO DISK = 'c:\dms-backups\TailspinToysLog.trn'
    WITH CHECKSUM
    GO
    ```

8. Execute the query by selecting **Execute** in the SSMS toolbar.

   ![The tailspintoys App Service is highlighted in the list of resource group resources.](media/rg-app-service.png "Resource group")

4. On the App Service blade, select **Configuration** under Settings on the left-hand side.

   ![The Configuration item is selected under Settings.](media/app-service-configuration-menu.png "Configuration")

5. On the Configuration blade, locate the **Connection strings** section, and then select the Pencil (Edit) icon to the right of the `TailspinToysContext` connection string.

    ![In the Connection string section, the pencil icon is highlighted to the right of the TailspinToysContext connection string.](media/app-service-configuration-connection-strings.png "Connection Strings")

6. The value of the connection string should look like:

    ```sql
    Server=tcp:your-sqlmi-host-fqdn-value,1433;Database=TailspinToys;User ID=sqlmiuser;Password=Password.1234567890;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;
    ```

7. In the Add/Edit connection string dialog, replace `your-sqlmi-host-fqdn-value` with the fully qualified domain name for your SQL MI that you copied to a text editor earlier from the Azure Cloud Shell.

    ![The your-sqlmi-host-fqdn-value string is highlighted in the connection string.](media/app-service-configuration-edit-conn-string.png "Edit Connection String")

8. The updated value should look similar to the following screenshot.

    ![The updated connection string is displayed, with the fully qualified domain name of SQL MI highlighted within the string.](media/app-service-configuration-edit-conn-string-value.png "Connection string value")

9. Select **OK**.

10. Repeat steps 3 - 7, this time for the `TailspinToysReadOnlyContext` connection string.

11. Select **Save** at the top of the Configuration blade.

    ![The save button on the Configuration blade is highlighted.](media/app-service-configuration-save.png "Save")

12. When prompted that changes to application settings and connection strings will restart your application, select **Continue**.

    ![The prompt warning that the application will be restarted is displayed, and the Continue button is highlighted.](media/app-service-restart.png "Restart prompt")

13. Select **Overview** to the left of the Configuration blade to return to the overview blade of your App Service.

    ![Overview is highlighted on the left-hand menu for App Service](media/app-service-overview-menu-item.png "Overview menu item")

14. At this point, selecting the **URL** for the App Service on the Overview blade still results in an error being return. This is because SQL Managed Instance has a private IP address in its VNet. To connect an application, you need to configure access to the VNet where Managed Instance is deployed, which you handle in the next exercise.

    ![An error screen is displayed, because the application is unable to connect to SQL MI within its private virtual network.](media/web-app-error-screen.png "Web App error")

## Exercise 4: Integrate App Service with the virtual network

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you Integrate your App Service with the virtual network that was created during the Before the hands-on lab exercises. The ARM template created a Gateway subnet on the VNet, as well as a Virtual Network Gateway. Both of these resources are required to integrate App Service and connect to SQL MI.

### Task 1: Set point-to-site addresses

In this task, you configure the client address pool. This is a range of private IP addresses that you specify below. Clients that connect over a Point-to-Site VPN dynamically receive an IP address from this range. You use a private IP address range that does not overlap with the VNet.

1. Navigate to the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX-vnet-gateway** Virtual network gateway in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) by selecting it from the list of resources in the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group.

    ![The Virtual network gateway resource is highlighted in the list of resources.](media/resource-group-vnet-gateway.png "Resources")

2. On the virtual network gateway blade, select **Point-to-site configuration** under Settings in the left-hand menu, and then select **Configure now**.

    ![Point-to-site configuration is highlighted and selected in the left-hand menu. On the Point-to-site configuration blade, Configure now is highlighted.](media/virtual-network-gateway-configure-point-to-site.png "Virtual network gateway")

3. On the **Point-to-site** configuration page, set the following configuration:

    - **Address pool**: Add a private IP address range that you want to use. The address space must be in one of the following address blocks, but should not overlap the address space used by the VNet.
      - `10.0.0.0/8` - This means an IP address range from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255
      - `172.16.0.0/12` - This means an IP address range from 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255
      - `192.168.0.0/16` - This means an IP address range from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255
    - **Tunnel type**: Select **SSTP (SSL)**.
    - **Authentication type**: Choose **Azure certificate**.

    ![The values specified above are entered into the Point-to-site configuration form.](media/virtual-network-gateway-point-to-site-configuration.png "Virtual network gateway")

4. Select **Save** to validate and save the settings. It takes a few minutes for the save to finish.

### Task 2: Configure VNet integration with App Services

In this task, you add the networking configuration to your App Service to enable communication with resources in the VNet.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** resource group and then select the **tailspintoysUNIQUEID** App Service from the list of resources.

   ![The tailspintoys App Service is highlighted in the list of resource group resources.](media/rg-app-service.png "Resource group")

2. On the App Service blade, select **Networking** from the left-hand menu and then select **Click here to configure** under **VNet Integration**.

    ![On the App Service blade, Networking is selected in the left-hand menu and Click here to configure is highlighted under VNet Integration.](media/app-service-networking.png "App Service")

3. Select **Add VNet** on the VNet Configuration blade.

    ![Add VNet is highlighted on the VNet Configuration blade.](media/app-service-vnet-configuration.png "App Service")

4. Select the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX-vnet** in the Virtual Network dialog.

    ![The hands-on-lab-SUFFIX-vnet** is highlighted.](media/app-service-vnet-configuration-add-vnet.png "App Service")

5. Within a few minutes, the VNet is added, and your App Service is restarted to apply the changes. Select **Refresh** to see the details. You should see that the certificate status is Certificates in sync. **Note**: If the certificate status is not in sync, try hitting refresh, as it can take a moment for that status to be reflected.

    ![The details of the VNet Configuration are displayed. The Certificate Status, Certificates in sync, is highlighted.](media/app-service-vnet-details.png "App Service")

    > **Note**: In you receive a message adding the Virtual Network to Web App failed, select **Disconnect** on the VNet Configuration blade, and repeat steps 3 - 5 above.

### Task 3: Open the web application

In this task, you verify your web application now loads, and you can see the home page of the web app.

1. Select **Overview** in the left-hand menu of your App Service, and select the **URL** of your App service to launch the website. This opens the URL in a browser window.

    ![The App service URL is highlighted.](media/app-service-url.png "App service URL")

2. Verify that the web site and data are loaded correctly. The page should look similar to the following:

    ![Screenshot of the TailspinToys Operations Web App.](media/tailspin-toys-web-app.png "TailspinToys Web")

    > **Note**: If you get an error screen, try selecting Refresh in the browser window.

3. That's it. You successfully connected your application to the new SQL MI database.

## Exercise 5: Improve database security posture with Advanced Data Security

Duration: 30 minutes

In this exercise, you enable Advanced Data Security (ADS) on your SQL MI database and explore some of the security benefits that come with running your database in Azure. [SQL Database Advance Data Security](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-advanced-data-security) (ADS) provides advanced SQL security capabilities, including functionality for discovering and classifying sensitive data, surfacing and mitigating potential database vulnerabilities, and detecting anomalous activities that could indicate a threat to your database.

### Task 1: Enable Advanced Data Security

In this task, you enable ADS for all databases on the Managed Instance.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Resource groups** from the Azure services list.

    ![Resource groups is highlighted in the Azure services list.](media/azure-services-resource-groups.png "Azure services")

2. Select the hands-on-lab-SUFFIX resource group from the list.

    ![Resource groups is selected in the Azure navigation pane, and the "hands-on-lab-SUFFIX" resource group is highlighted.](./media/resource-groups.png "Resource groups list")

3. Select the **TailspinToys** Managed database resource from the list.

    ![The TailspinToys Managed Database is highlighted in the resources list.](media/resources-sql-mi-database.png "Resources")

4. On the TailspinToys Managed database blade, select **Advanced Data Security** from the left-hand menu, under Security, and then select **Enable Advanced Data Security on the managed instance**.

    ![Advanced Data Security is selected and highlighted in the left-hand menu of the Managed database blade, and the Enable Advanced Data Security on the managed instance button is highlighted.](media/sql-mi-managed-database-advanced-data-security-enable.png "Advanced Data Security")

5. Within a few minutes, ADS is enabled for all databases on the Managed Instance. You will see the three tiles on the Advanced Data Security blade become enabled and populated with data when it has finished.

    ![The enabled tiles on the Advance Data Security blade are displayed.](media/ads-panels.png "Advanced Data Security")

### Task 2: Configure SQL Data Discovery and Classification

In this task, you review the [SQL Data Discovery and Classification](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-data-discovery-and-classification?view=sql-server-2017) feature of Advanced Data Security. Data Discovery & Classification introduces a new tool for discovering, classifying, labeling, and reporting the sensitive data in your databases. It introduces a set of advanced services, forming a new SQL Information Protection paradigm aimed at protecting the data in your database, not just the database. Discovering and classifying your most sensitive data (e.g., business, financial, healthcare) can play a pivotal role in your organizational information protection stature.

1. On the Advanced Data Security blade, select the **Data Discovery & Classification** tile.

    ![The Data Discovery & Classification tile is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-pane.png "Advanced Data Security")

2. In the **Data Discovery & Classification** blade, select the info link with the message **We have found 35 columns with classification recommendations**.

    ![The recommendations link on the Data Discovery & Classification blade is highlighted.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-link.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

3. Look over the list of recommendations to get a better understanding of the types of data and classifications that can be assigned, based on the built-in classification settings. In the list of classification recommendations, select the recommendation for the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field.

    ![The CreditCard number recommendation is highlighted in the recommendations list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-credit-card.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

4. Due to the risk of exposing credit card information, Tailspin Toys would like a way to classify it as highly confidential, not just **Confidential**, as the recommendation suggests. To correct this, select **+ Add classification** at the top of the Data Discovery & Classification blade.

    ![The +Add classification button is highlighted in the toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-classification-button.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

5. Quickly expand the **Sensitivity label** field, and review the various built-in labels from which you can choose. You can also add custom labels, should you desire.

    ![The list of built-in Sensitivity labels is displayed.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-sensitivity-labels.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

6. In the Add classification dialog, enter the following:

    - **Schema name**: Select **Sales**.
    - **Table name**: Select **CreditCard**.
    - **Column name**: Select **CardNumber (nvarchar)**.
    - **Information type**: Select **Credit Card**.
    - **Sensitivity level**: Select **Highly Confidential**.

    ![The values specified above are entered into the Add classification dialog.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-add-classification.png "Add classification")

7. Select **Add classification**.

8. Notice that the **Sales - CreditCard - CardNumber** field disappears from the recommendations list, and the number of recommendations drops by 1.

9. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window. It may take several minutes for the save to complete.

    ![Save the updates to the classified columns list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-save.png "Save")

10. Other recommendations you can review are the **HumanResources - Employee** fields for **NationIDNumber** and **BirthDate**. Note that the recommendation service flagged these fields as **Confidential - GDPR**. Tailspin Toys maintains data about gamers from around the world, including Europe, so having a tool that helps them discover data that may be relevant to GDPR compliance is very helpful.

    ![GDPR information is highlighted in the list of recommendations](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-recommendations-gdpr.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

11. Check the **Select all** checkbox at the top of the list to select all the remaining recommended classifications, and then select **Accept selected recommendations**.

    ![All the recommended classifications are checked, and the Accept selected recommendations button is highlighted.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-accept-recommendations.png "Data Discovery & Classification")

12. Select **Save** on the toolbar of the Data Classification window. It may take several minutes for the save to complete.

    ![Save the updates to the classified columns list.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-save.png "Save")

    >**Note**: If you receive an error when saving, try returning to the Advanced Data Security blade, and selecting the Data Discovery & Classification tile again to see the results.

13. When the save completes, select the **Overview** tab on the Data Discovery & Classification blade to view a report with a full summary of the database classification state.

    ![The View Report button is highlighted on the toolbar.](media/ads-data-discovery-and-classification-overview-report.png "View report")

### Task 3: Review an Advanced Data Security Vulnerability Assessment

In this task, you review an assessment report generated by ADS for the `TailspinToys` database and take action to remediate one of the findings in the `TailspinToys` database. The [SQL Vulnerability Assessment service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-vulnerability-assessment) is a service that provides visibility into your security state and includes actionable steps to resolve security issues and enhance your database security.

1. Return to the **Advanced Data Security** blade for the `TailspinToys` Managed database and then select the **Vulnerability Assessment** tile.

    ![The Vulnerability tile is displayed.](media/ads-vulnerability-assessment-tile.png "Advanced Data Security")

2. On the Vulnerability Assessment blade, select **Scan** on the toolbar.

    ![The Vulnerability assessment scan button is selected in the toolbar.](media/vulnerability-assessment-scan.png "Scan")

3. When the scan completes, a dashboard displaying the number of failing and passing checks, along with a breakdown of the risk summary by severity level is displayed.

    ![The Vulnerability Assessment dashboard is displayed.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-dashboard.png "Vulnerability Assessment dashboard")

4. In the scan results, take a few minutes to browse both the Failed and Passed checks, and review the types of checks that are performed. In the **Failed** the list, locate the security check for **Transparent data encryption**. This check has an ID of **VA1219**.

    ![The VA1219 finding for Transparent data encryption is highlighted.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-failed-va1219.png "Vulnerability assessment")

5. Select the **VA1219** finding to view the detailed description.

    ![The details of the VA1219 - Transparent data encryption should be enabled finding are displayed with the description, impact, and remediation fields highlighted.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-failed-va1219-details.png "Vulnerability Assessment")

    > The details for each finding provide more insight into the reason for the finding. Of note are fields describing the finding, the impact of the recommended settings, and details on remediation for the finding.

6. You will now act on the recommended remediation steps for the finding and enable [Transparent Data Encryption](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/transparent-data-encryption-azure-sql) for the `TailspinToys` database. To accomplish this, switch over to using SSMS on your JumpBox VM for the next few steps.

    >**Note**: Transparent data encryption (TDE) needs to be manually enabled for Azure SQL Managed Instance. TDE helps protect Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Data Warehouse against the threat of malicious activity. It performs real-time encryption and decryption of the database, associated backups, and transaction log files at rest without requiring changes to the application.

7. On your JumpBox VM, open Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 18 from the Start menu, and enter the following information in the **Connect to Server** dialog.

    - **Server name**: Enter the fully qualified domain name of your SQL managed instance, which you copied from the Azure Cloud Shell in a previous task.
    - **Authentication**: Select **SQL Server Authentication**.
    - **Login**: Enter `sqlmiuser`
    - **Password**: Enter `Password.1234567890`
    - Check the **Remember password** box.

    ![The SQL managed instance details specified above are entered into the Connect to Server dialog.](media/ssms-18-connect-to-server.png "Connect to Server")

8. In SSMS, select **New Query** from the toolbar, paste the following SQL script into the new query window.

    ```sql
    USE TailspinToys;
    GO

    ALTER DATABASE [TailspinToys] SET ENCRYPTION ON
    ```

    > You turn transparent data encryption on and off on the database level. To enable transparent data encryption on a database in Azure SQL Managed Instance use must use T-SQL.

9. Select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar. After a few seconds, you will see a message that the "Commands completed successfully."

10. You can verify the encryption state and view information the associated encryption keys by using the [sys.dm_database_encryption_keys view](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/relational-databases/system-dynamic-management-views/sys-dm-database-encryption-keys-transact-sql). Select **New Query** on the SSMS toolbar again, and paste the following query into the new query window:

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM sys.dm_database_encryption_keys
    ```

    ![The query above is pasted into a new query window in SSMS.](media/ssms-sql-mi-database-encryption-keys.png "New query")

11. Select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar. You will see two records in the Results window, which provide information about the encryption state and keys used for encryption.

    ![The Execute button on the SSMS toolbar is highlighted, and in the Results pane the two records about the encryption state and keys for the TailspinToys database are highlighted.](media/ssms-sql-mi-database-encryption-keys-results.png "Results")

    > By default, service-managed transparent data encryption is used. A transparent data encryption certificate is automatically generated for the server that contains the database.

12. Return to the Azure portal and the Advanced Data Security - Vulnerability Assessment blade of the `TailspinToys` managed database. On the toolbar, select **Scan** to start a new assessment of the database.

    ![The Vulnerability assessment scan button is selected in the toolbar.](media/vulnerability-assessment-scan.png "Scan")

13. When the scan completes, select the **Failed** tab, enter **VA1219** into the search filter box, and observe that the previous failure is no longer in the Failed list.

    ![The Failed tab is highlighted, and VA1219 is entered into the search filter. The list displays no results.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-failed-filter-va1219.png "Failed")

14. Now, select the **Passed** tab, and observe the **VA1219** check is listed with a status of **PASS**.

    ![The Passed tab is highlighted, and VA1219 is entered into the search filter. VA1219 with a status of PASS is highlighted in the results.](media/sql-mi-vulnerability-assessment-passed-va1219.png "Passed")

    > Using the SQL Vulnerability Assessment, it is simple to identify and remediate potential database vulnerabilities, allowing you to improve your database security proactively.

## Exercise 6: Enable Dynamic Data Masking

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you enable [Dynamic Data Masking](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-dynamic-data-masking-get-started) (DDM) on credit card numbers in the `TailspinToys` database. DDM limits sensitive data exposure by masking it to non-privileged users. This feature helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data by enabling customers to designate how much of the sensitive data to reveal with minimal impact on the application layer. It is a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.

> For example, a service representative at a call center may identify callers by several digits of their credit card number, but those data items should not be fully exposed to the service representative. A masking rule can be defined that masks all but the last four digits of any credit card number in the result set of any query. As another example, an appropriate data mask can be defined to protect personally identifiable information (PII) data, so that a developer can query production environments for troubleshooting purposes without violating compliance regulations.

### Task 1: Enable DDM on credit card numbers

When inspecting the data in the `TailspinToys` database using the ADS Data Discovery & Classification tool, you set the Sensitivity label for credit card numbers to Highly Confidential. In this task, you take another step to protect this information by enabling DDM on the `CardNumber` field in the `CreditCard` table. DDM prevents queries against that table from returning the full credit card number.

1. On your JumpBox VM, return to the SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) window you opened previously.

2. Expand **Tables** under the **TailspinToys** database and locate the `Sales.CreditCard` table. Expand the table columns and observe that there is a column named `CardNumber`. Right-click the table, and choose **Select Top 1000 Rows** from the context menu.

   ![The Select Top 1000 Rows item is highlighted in the context menu for the Sales.CreditCard table.](media/ssms-sql-mi-credit-card-table-select.png "Select Top 1000 Rows")

3. In the query window that opens, review the Results, including the `CardNumber` field. Notice it is displayed in plain text, making the data available to anyone with access to query the database.

   ![Plain text credit card numbers are highlighted in the query results.](media/ssms-sql-mi-credit-card-table-select-results.png "Results")

4. To be able to test the mask being applied to the `CardNumber` field, you first create a user in the database to use for testing the masked field. In SSMS, select **New Query** and paste the following SQL script into the new query window:

   ```sql
   USE [TailspinToys];
   GO

   CREATE USER DDMUser WITHOUT LOGIN;
   GRANT SELECT ON [Sales].[CreditCard] TO DDMUser;
   ```

   > The SQL script above creates a new user in the database named `DDMUser`, and grants that user `SELECT` rights on the `Sales.CreditCard` table.

5. Select **Execute** from the SSMS toolbar to run the query. You will get a message that the commands completed successfully in the Messages pane.

6. With the new user created, run a quick query to observe the results. Select **New Query** again, and paste the following into the new query window.

   ```sql
   USE [TailspinToys];
   GO

   EXECUTE AS USER = 'DDMUser';
   SELECT * FROM [Sales].[CreditCard];
   REVERT;
   ```

7. Select **Execute** from the toolbar and examine the Results pane. Notice the credit card number, as above, is visible in plain text.

   ![The credit card number is unmasked in the query results.](media/ssms-sql-mi-ddm-results-unmasked.png "Query results")

8. You now apply DDM on the `CardNumber` field to prevent it from being viewed in query results. Select **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar and paste the following query into the query window to apply a mask to the `CardNumber` field, and select **Execute**.

   ```sql
   USE [TailspinToys];
   GO

   ALTER TABLE [Sales].[CreditCard]
   ALTER COLUMN [CardNumber] NVARCHAR(25) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'partial(0,"xxx-xxx-xxx-",4)')
   ```

9. Run the `SELECT` query you opened in step 6 above again, and observe the results. Specifically, inspect the output in the `CardNumber` field. For reference, the query is below.

    ```sql
    USE [TailspinToys];
    GO

    EXECUTE AS USER = 'DDMUser';
    SELECT * FROM [Sales].[CreditCard];
    REVERT;
    ```

    ![The credit card number is masked in the query results.](media/ssms-sql-mi-ddm-results-masked.png "Query results")

    > The `CardNumber` is now displayed using the mask applied to it, so only the last four digits of the card number are visible. Dynamic Data Masking is a powerful feature that enables you to prevent unauthorized users from viewing sensitive or restricted information. It's a policy-based security feature that hides the sensitive data in the result set of a query over designated database fields, while the data in the database is not changed.

### Task 2: Apply DDM to email addresses

From the findings of the Data Discovery & Classification report in ADS, you saw that email addresses are labeled Confidential. In this task, you use one of the built-in functions for making email addresses using DDM to help protect this information.

1. For this, you target the `LoginEmail` field in the `[dbo].[Gamer]` table. Open a new query window and execute the following script:

    ```sql
    USE [TailspinToys];
    GO

    SELECT TOP(100) * FROM [dbo].[Gamer]
    ```

    ![In the query results, full email addresses are visible.](media/ddm-select-gamer-results.png "Query results")

2. Now, as you did above, grant the `DDMUser` `SELECT` rights on the [dbo].[Gamer]. In a new query window and enter the following script, and then select **Execute**:

   ```sql
   USE [TailspinToys];
   GO

   GRANT SELECT ON [dbo].[Gamer] to DDMUser;
   ```

3. Next, apply DDM on the `LoginEmail` field to prevent it from being viewed in full in query results. Select **New Query** from the SSMS toolbar and paste the following query into the query window to apply a mask to the `LoginEmail` field, and then select **Execute**.

   ```sql
   USE [TailspinToys];
   GO

   ALTER TABLE [dbo].[Gamer]
   ALTER COLUMN [LoginEmail] NVARCHAR(250) MASKED WITH (FUNCTION = 'Email()');
   ```

   > **Note**: Observe the use of the built-in `Email()` masking function above. This is one of several pre-defined masks available in SQL Server databases.

4. Run the `SELECT` query below, and observe the results. Specifically, inspect the output in the `LoginEmail` field. For reference, the query is below.

    ```sql
    USE [TailspinToys];
    GO

    EXECUTE AS USER = 'DDMUser';
    SELECT * FROM [dbo].[Gamer];
    REVERT;
    ```

    ![The email addresses are masked in the query results.](media/ddm-select-gamer-results-masked.png "Query results")

## Exercise 7: Use online secondary for read-only queries

Duration: 15 minutes

In this exercise, you examine how you can use the automatically created online secondary for reporting, without feeling the impacts of a heavy transactional load on the primary database. Each database in the SQL MI Business Critical tier is automatically provisioned with several AlwaysON replicas to support the availability SLA. Using [**Read Scale-Out**](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/sql-database/sql-database-read-scale-out) allows you to load balance Azure SQL Database read-only workloads using the capacity of one read-only replica.

### Task 1: View Leaderboard report in TailspinToys web application

5. In the TailspinToys web app, select **Leaderboard** from the menu.

   ![READ_WRITE is highlighted on the Leaderboard page.](media/tailspin-toys-leaderboard-read-write.png "TailspinToys Web App")

   > Note the `READ_WRITE` string on the page. This is the output from reading the `Updateability` property associated with the `ApplicationIntent` option on the target database. This can be retrieved using the SQL query `SELECT DATABASEPROPERTYEX(DB_NAME(), "Updateability")`.

### Task 2: Update read-only connection string

In this task, you enable Read Scale-Out for the `TailspinToys`database, using the `ApplicationIntent` option in the connection string. This option dictates whether the connection is routed to the write replica or a read-only replica. Specifically, if the `ApplicationIntent` value is `ReadWrite` (the default value), the connection is directed to the database's read-write replica. If the `ApplicationIntent` value is `ReadOnly`, the connection is routed to a read-only replica.

1. Return to the App Service blade in the Azure portal and select **Configuration** under Settings on the left-hand side.

   ![The Configuration item is selected under Settings.](media/app-service-configuration-menu.png "Configuration")

2. On the Configuration blade, scroll down and locate the connection string named `TailspinToysReadOnlyContext` within the **Connection strings** section, and select the Pencil (edit) icon on the right.

   ![The edit icon next to the read-only connection string is highlighted.](media/app-service-configuration-connection-strings-read-only.png "Connection strings")

3. In the Add/Edit connection string dialog, select the **Value** for the `TailspinToysReadOnlyContext` and paste the following parameter to the end of the connection string.

   ```sql
   ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
   ```

4. The `TailspinToysReadOnlyContext` connection string should now look something like the following:

   ```sql
   Server=tcp:sqlmi-abcmxwzksiqoo.15b8611394c5.database.windows.net,1433;Database=TailspinToys;User ID=sqlmiuser;Password=Password.1234567890;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;ApplicationIntent=ReadOnly;
   ```

5. Select **OK**.

6. Select **Save** at the top of the Configuration blade, and select **Continue** when prompted about the application being restarted.

   ![The save button on the Application settings blade is highlighted.](media/app-service-configuration-save.png "Save")

### Task 3: Reload Leaderboard report in the Tailspin Toys web app

In this task, you refresh the Leaderboard report in the Tailspin Toys web app, and observe the result.

1. Return to the TailspinToys gamer information website you opened previously, and refresh the **Leaderboard** page. The page should now look similar to the following:

    ![READ_ONLY is highlighted on the Reports page.](media/tailspin-toys-leaderboard-read-only.png "TailspinToys Web App")

    > Notice the `updateability` option is now displaying as `READ_ONLY`. With a simple addition to your database connection string, you can send read-only queries to the online secondary of your SQL MI Business-critical database, allowing you to load-balance read-only workloads using the capacity of one read-only replica. The SQL MI Business Critical cluster has built-in Read Scale-Out capability that provides free-of-charge built-in read-only node that can be used to run read-only queries that should not affect the performance of your primary workload.

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 minutes

In this exercise, you de-provision all Azure resources that you created in support of this hands-on lab.

### Task 1: Delete Azure resource groups

1. In the Azure portal, select **Resource groups** from the left-hand menu, and locate and delete the **hands-on-lab-SUFFIX** following resource group.

    > **Note**: Deleting a resource group containing SQL MI does not always work the first time, resulting in a few networking components (route table, SQL MI NSG, and VNet) remaining in the resource group after the first delete attempt. In this case, wait for the first process to complete, and then attempt to delete the resource group a second time. You may need to allow several hours or more between delete attempts.

### Task 2: Delete the tailspin-toys service principal

1. In the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory** and then select **App registrations**.

2. Select the **tailspin-toys** application, and select **Delete** on the application blade.

You should follow all steps provided *after* attending the Hands-on lab.
